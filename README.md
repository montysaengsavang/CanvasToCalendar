# CanvasToCalendar
Directly pull upcoming assignments from SJSU's Canvas system and create events for them in Google Calendar

According to Canvas' API (https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.oauth.html#oauth2-flow-0), it is a violation of terms of service to ask users to manually generate access tokens to run this application. In order for the application to perform the OAuth flow to generate a token, I must obtain a developer key issued by the admin of my institution (San Jose State). 

At the moment, I am unable to receive a developer key and want to establish the fact that this application is currently for my use only and it is still in the testing phase. Therefore, as a student at San Jose State, I am able to use my own manually generated token to pull my assignments and create their respective events on google calendar.

I do not permit anyone to use this application, however, I do permit them to view this project to create their own versions for personal use.
